We are independent team of researchers who are enchanted with the beauty of artificial intelligence field. Our ambition is to develop general purpose learning algorithms. We are interested in such sub-fields as deep learning, reinforcement learning. Bearing this in mind, we are trying to maintain an open attitude to exciting new ideas that are flying around right now and waiting for the ones who are persistent and witted enough. 

Team is based in Russia, with some of the people in Moscow and others in St. Petersburg. All our research activity is well presented on the team blog with references to articles. 

If you want to contact us, just drop a letter to 5visionteam@gmail.com or come to one of our seminars that we conduct in Moscow for more thorough discussion.
